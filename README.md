# Naive_Bayes_HeartDisease_prediction
- Here we predict whether one is at risk of heart disease from existing data.
- we do this by training a model and make predictions
# Why Naive_Bayes.
- Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine-learning model.I choosed this because:
•	They are extremely fast for both training and prediction
•	They provide straightforward probabilistic prediction
•	They are often very easily interpretable
- In this classifier, the assumption is that data from each label is drawn from a simple Gaussian distribution.
Below is the mathematical equation of Bayes theorem.
